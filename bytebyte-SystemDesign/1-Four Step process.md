# Four Step Process

## Understand the problem and establish design scope (3 to 10 mins)

    - problem we are trying to solve (imp features of the product)
    - Features we are going to build (ex. mobile/web/both)
    - how many users the product has (traffic/day, traffic at peak)
    - how fast the product can scale up
    - technology stack to use

## Propose high-level design and get buy-in (10 - 15 mins)

    - create inital blueprint. Get feedback. Redesign
    - Use whiteboard/paper

## Design Deep dive (10 - 25 mins)

    - identify and prioritize components in the architecture

## Wrap up (3 -5 mins)

    - identify bottlenecks and potential improvements
    - Operation issues - how to monitor metrics and error logs
    - scaling the infra
